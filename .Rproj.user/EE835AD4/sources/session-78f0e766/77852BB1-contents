Description: Provides analysis tools for big data where the sample size is very large. It offers
             a suite of functions for fitting and predicting joint models, which allow for the simultaneous
             analysis of longitudinal and time-to-event data. This statistical methodology is particularly 
             useful in medical research where there is often interest in understanding the relationship 
             between a longitudinal biomarker and a clinical outcome, such as survival or disease progression.
             This can be particularly useful in a clinical setting where it is important to be able to predict 
             how a patient's health status may change over time. Overall, this package provides a 
             comprehensive set of tools for joint modeling of BIG data obtained as survival and 
             longitudinal outcomes with both Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches. Its versatility
             and flexibility make it a valuable resource for researchers in many different fields,
             particularly in the medical and health sciences.
